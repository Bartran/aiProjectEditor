Explore your repository, select files, export the content to your clipboard. Save session, reload session. ThatÂ´s pretty much it.

What for? So you can copy and paste a few files of your repo and ask an AI to do the boring stuff.

Click on select folder, load the main directory. (will load all files within, be careful)

Click on the ones you want to add to the context, and then copy context. If the files are modified, click in reload to read again the new content and reload it in your clipboard.

Use it on your own risk, you will be better off downloading and reading the code.
